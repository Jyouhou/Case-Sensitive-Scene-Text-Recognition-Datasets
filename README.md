## Background
The annotations of $4$ of the most popular scene text recognition datasets are incomplete. 
They are IIIT5K, SVT, SVTP, and CUTE-80. 
They only provide case-insensitive annotations and no punctuation marks. 

For better understanding of scene text recognition models, we re-annotate these datasets and release them.
